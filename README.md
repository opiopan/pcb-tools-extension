pcb-tools-extension
===
pcb-tools-extension is a Python library to panelize gerber files.
This library is designed based on [pcb-tools](https://github.com/curtacircuitos/pcb-tools) which provides cool functionality to handle PCB such as generating PCB image from gerber files.

pcb-tools-extension adds following function to pcb-tools.

- Rotate PCB data
- Write back loaded PCB data (original pcb-tools does not work in some condition)
- Merge multiple PCB data
- Translate DXF file to PCB data

Only RS-274x format and Excellon drill format data can be handled by current version of this library.

## Installation
You can install a stable version by following step.

```shell
$ pip install pcb-tools-extension
```

If you have a intention to try latest developing version, please install as follows.

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/opiopan/pcb-tools-extension.git
```

## How to panelize
Following code is a example to panelize two top metal layer files.

``` python
import gerberex

ctx = gerberex.GerberComposition()

metal1 = gerberex.read('board1.gtl')
ctx.merge(metal1)

metal2 = gerberex.read('board2.gtl')
metal2.to_metric()
metal2.rotate(-20)
metal2.offset(30, 0)
ctx.merge(metal2)

ctx.dump('panelized-board.gtl')
```

```rotate()``` method can be used to rotate PCB data counterclockwise. you have to specify angle in degree.<br>
```offset()``` method can be used to move PCB data. Specified offset values are interpreted according to unit setting of PCB data. In case of the above code, ```board2.gtl``` move to 30mm left since ```to_metric()``` is called.

In case of Excellon drill data, you have to use ```DrillCompositon``` instead of ```GerberComposition```.

```python
import gerberex

ctx = gerberex.DrillComposition()

drill1 = gerberex.read('board1.txt')
ctx.merge(drill1)

drill2 = gerberex.read('board2.txt')
drill2.to_metric()
drill2.rotate(-20)
drill2.offset(30, 0)
ctx.merge(drill2)

ctx.dump('panelized-board.txt')
```

## DXF file translation
pcb-tools-extension has a function to load a DXF file and handle that as same as RX-274x gerber file or Excellon NC file.<br>
In this version, Only line, circle, arc, and polyline objects are recognized and are translated to gerber file or NC file.

### Two way to translate DXF file
Both composition objects, ```GerberComposition``` for RX-274x and ```DrillionComposition``` for Excellon, can accept an object created as result of DXF file loaded. When composition object dump text stream, DXF data tranclate to appropriate format data.<br>
The object which represent DXF file, can also output translated data directly by ```save``` method. In this case output format is specified by ```filetype``` argument. If ```filetype``` argument is omitted, DXF data is translated to RX-274x gerber data.

```python
import gerberex
dxf = gerberex.read('sample.dxf')

# translate to RX-274x using composition object
ctx = gerberex.GerberComposition()
ctx.merge(dxf)
ctx.dump('sample.gml')

# translate to Excellon using composition object
ctx = gerberex.DrillComposition()
ctx.merge(dxf)
ctx.dump('sample.txt')

# translate to RX-274x directly
dxf.save('sample2.gml')

# translate to Excellon directly
dxf.save('sample2.txt', filetype=dxf.FT_EXCELLON)
```

### Generating Rectangle
If you want to arrange simple rectangle for PCB outline, ```gerberex.rectangle()``` is better solution. This generate a object representing a rectangle compatible with DXF file object.<br>

```python
import gerberex

outline = gerberex.rectangle(width=100, height=100, units='metric')
outline.write('outline.gml')
```

### Drawing Mode
PCB tools extension provide three type of translation method that affects geometric finish. These method are specified a value for ```draw_mode``` attribute, as ```DM_LINE```, ```DM_MOUSE_BITES```, or ```DM_FILL```.<br>
```DM_LINE``` and ```DM_MOUSE_BITES``` are used to translate to both of RX-274x and Excellon, however ```DM_FILL``` is used to translate to only RX-274x.

![Drawing Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/opiopan/pcb-tools-extension/images/draw_mode.jpg)

- **draw_mode = DM_LINE**<br>
    All edge expressed as DXF line object, circle object, arc object and plyline objects are translated to line and arc applied a circular aperture in case of RX-274x. That circular aperture radius is specified by ```width``` attribute. Default value of width is 0.<br>
    In case of Excellon, DXF objects are translated to routing path command sequence.<br>
    This function is useful to generate outline data of panelized PCB board.

    ```python
    import gerberex

    dxf = gerberex.read('outline.dxf')
    dxf.to_inch()
    dxf.width = 0.004
    dxf.write('outline.gml')
    ```

- **draw_mode = DM_MOUSE_BITES**<br>
    <img alt="mouse bites" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/opiopan/pcb-tools-extension/images/mousebites.png" width=200 align="right">
    If DM_MOUSE_BITES is specified for draw_mode, filled circles are arranged at equal intervals along a paths consisted of DXF line, arc, circle, and polyline objects.
    DXF file object in this state can be merged to Excellon file also. That means you can arrange mouse bites easily.

    ```python
    import gerberex

    ctx = gerberex.DrillComposition()
    drill = gerberex.read('drill.txt')
    ctx.merge(drill)

    dxf = gerberex.read('mousebites.dxf')
    dxf.draw_mode = dxf.DM_MOUSE_BITES
    dxf.to_metric()
    dxf.width = 0.5
    dxf.pitch = 1
    ctx.merge(dxf)

    ctx.dump('merged_drill.txt')
    ```

- **draw_mode = DM_FILL**<br>
    You can translate DXF closed shapes such as circle to RX-274x polygon fill sequence.<br>
    In order to fill closed shapes, ```DM_FILL``` has to be set to ```draw_mode``` property. In this mode, All object except closed shapes listed below are ignored.

    - circle
    - closed polyline
    - closed path which consists of lines and arcs

    If a closed shape is completely included in other closed shape, The inner shape will be draw with reversed polarity of container shape as above example image.<br>

    I assume there are two typical use cases for this mode.<br>
    One is to arrange logo design on silk layer. This is superior to other method generating raster image data since image data express as vector data.<br>
    The other one is generating gerber data represented cropped area of panelized PCB.
    By merging rectangle and PCB outline data, generate a file represented cropped area as below, and this kind of data is useful to make PCB image look good a little bit.<br>
    [This script](https://github.com/opiopan/pcb-tools-extension/blob/master/examples/genimage.py) which generate example image shown below, also uses this technic.

    ```python
    import gerberex

    ctx = gerberex.GerberComposition()

    rectangle = gerberex.rectangle(width=100, height=100, left=0, bottom=0, units='metric')
    rectangle.draw_mode = rectangle.DM_FILL
    ctx.merge(rectangle)

    outline = gerberex.read('outline.dxf')
    outline.draw_mode = outline.DM_FILL
    outline.negate_polarity()
    ctx.merge(outline)

    ctx.dump('cropped_area.gml')
    ```

    NOTE: ```DM_FILL``` can be used only to generate RX-274x data, it cannot be used to generate Excellon data.

## Notes

### Equivalence of output
pcb-tools-extension generate data block stream to focus equivalence of final image, but not focus equivalence of data block sequence.
There are some difference between input data and output data as below.

- **Aperture definition [RS-274x]**<br>
    When gerber data is rotated, it's necessary to rotate not only coordinates which indicate locations of drawing aperture, but also aperture geometry itself.
    However, standard aperture templates, such as rectangle, cannot rotate. These standard aperture templates can be placed only horizontally or vertically.<br>
    Threfore, pcb-tools-extension replace aperture definitions using standard aperture template to aperture macro that represent equivalent shape.<br>
    For example, In case of rotating following aperture definition 20 degrees counter clockwise,

    ```rs-274x
    %ADD10R,1X0.5X0.2*%
    ```

    pcb-toolse-extension generate a aperture macro definition and a aperture definition referencing that macro as below.

    ```rs-274x
    %AMMACR*
    21,1,$1,$2,0,0,20*
    1,0,$3,0,0,20*%
    %ADD10MACR,1X0.5X0.2*%
    ```

- **File Scope Modifier [RS-274x]**<br>
    Commands that affect entire image and should be specified only once in a file, such as ```MI``` (Mirror Image) command, sometimes cause contradiction when multiple gerber file are merged.<br>
    For example, when merging a file containing ```%MIA1B0*%``` command and a file containing ```%MIA0B1*``` command, which command should remain as output?
    Of cause, it is impossible that generate correct merged image by specifying any ```MI``` command.<br>
    pcb-tools-extension translates coordinate data reflecting this file scope modifier to address this problem, then omit this modifier command.<br>
    ```MI```, ```OF```, ```SF```, ```AS```, ```IP```, and ```IR``` are in a this category.

- **Coodinate Normalizing [RS-274x, Excellon]**<br>
    RS-274x specification and Excellon specification allow various notation to express a coordinate. However pcb-tools-extension normalize coordinate notation in order to correct deprecated notation and ease internal process as below.

    - Relative coordinates are translated to absolute coordinates.
    - Omitted coordinate values are compensated.
    - Leading zeros are omitted.

- **Single Quadlant mode [RS-274x]**<br>
    Circular interpolation coordinate data in single quadrant is difficult to rotate, because circular arc may pass across two quadrants after rotation.<br>
    In order to avoid this problem, pcb-tools-extension change single quadrant mode coordinates specification to multi quadrant mode.

- **NC controll command [Excellon]**<br>
    For historical reasons, Excellon NC control format is used to specify drill information to PCB fabricator.<br>
    On the other hand, from PCB fabricator point of view, they don't need information other than geometric information, such as drill speed. Because these NC control sequence doesn't send to NC machine directly, PCB fabricator import customers Excellon NC file to their CAD / CAM to panelize and check, then they export NC control data for their NC machine.<br>
    pcb-tools-extension omit all NC command which do not contribute to geometry expression. Specifically, only tool definitions (diameter of drill), tool selections, drilling coordinates, and routing paths are output.

- **Unimportant Command [RS-274x, Excellon]**<br>
    Commands not affecting final image such as comment are omitted.

### Negative image polarity
Sometimes, ```%IPNEG*%``` is specified at header of RS-274x file to create negative image. <br>
As mentioned [above](#Equivalence%20of%20output), ```IP``` command is omitted when pcb-tools-extension generate output file. In this case, image polarity is negated by using ```LP``` command. However this generated file doesn't equal to original image since it doesn't contain base dark image.<br>
Please merge base dark rectangle explicitly when you handle negative image file as below.

```python
import gerberex

ctx = gerberex.GerberComposition()
base = gerberex.rectangle(width=30, height=30, left=-5, bottom=-5, units='metric')
base.draw_mode = base.DM_FILL
ctx.merge(base)
metal = gerberex.read('negative_image.gtl')
ctx.merge(metal)
```

## Limitations

### RS-274x
pcb-tools-extension cannot handle all commands that the RS-274x parser implemented in
[pcb-tools](https://github.com/curtacircuitos/pcb-tools) doesn't handle so far.<br>
From the imaging point of view, pcb-tools-extension has following limitations.

- Files contains ```IJ``` and ```IO``` commands, that affect entire image, cannot be handled correctly.
- Files contains ```SR``` command to specify repeated pattern cannot be handled correctly.
- Aperture block defined by ```AB``` command cannot be handled correctly.

### Excellon
pcb-tools-extension extends Excellon parser in [pcb-tools](https://github.com/curtacircuitos/pcb-tools) to support routing operation. However following limitations still remain.

- User defined stored pattern defined by ```M99``` command cannot be handled.
- Canned text specified by ```M97``` command cannot be handled.
- Pattern defined by ```M25``` command cannot be handled.
